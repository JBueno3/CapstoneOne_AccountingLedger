# Financial Tracker CLI

This Java program is a command line interface for tracking financial transactions. It allows users to add transactions, view them and save them to a cvs file.

Features
Add transactions with details such as description, vendor, and amount.
View a list of all transactions.
Save transactions to a CSV file.

Interesting Piece of code
So First I assigned a string called File Name to transactions cvs.

In my main class, I created a Instance of a scanner to be able to get the user's input.

I then created a list named "transactions" and added a new array list. Then I used System.out.printin so the user can view the options "Add Transactions, View Transactions, Exit."

Then I created a while loop and what it does is it loops through a block of codes as long as the specified condition is true.
